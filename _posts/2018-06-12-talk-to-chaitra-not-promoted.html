In that case, if you keep waiting for your boss to notice your hard work and promote you, you might be in store for a long, long, wait.

Quantify your Value</h5><p data-empty="true">You may be a valuable employee to the organization but that doesn't mean anything unless the numbers speak.

Help them stay aware by regularly sharing updates on the milestones you have crossed, goals you have achieved and contributions you have made.&nbsp;</p><h5>4. Determine what it will take</h5><p data-empty="true">Ask your manager what it will take for him/her to promote you. Don't settle for vague answers like "You need to show better results."
