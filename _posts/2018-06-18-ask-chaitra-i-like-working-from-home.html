Fortunately, that can be easily remedied by stepping out or inviting friends over. &nbsp;But an even more pressing issue is the one you face - feeling like an outsider in your team / organization.

<p>Dear Chandrika,</p>
<p>I know what you're going through. Many of my friends and family members have expressed their jealousy over my work schedule because I get to work from home 95% of the time. They are envious of the fact that I can work in my ratty old t-shirt and take an afternoon nap while they have to make their way through traffic-filled roads and struggle to stay awake in boring meetings. Little do they know that sometimes my working hours are quite lonesome with no human interaction (unless you count thanking the delivery guy for bringing me food on the days I don't cook as human interaction) until my roommate returns. On the days the loneliness gets too much to bear, I like to torture myself by scrolling through my Instagram feed and going through pictures of my non-WFH friends having fun at work with their colleagues or enjoying a team lunch.</p>
<p>Having spoken to many clients who work remotely themselves, I have come to understand that loneliness is a common problem most remote workers face. Fortunately, that can be easily remedied by stepping out or inviting friends over.  But an even more pressing issue is the one you face - feeling like an outsider in your team / organization. This, unfortunately, is a little more time-consuming to fix. However with these 4 simple steps, you will soon be able to enjoy the camaraderie that you are craving for.</p>
<h5>1. Don't talk about work all the time</h5>
<p>To establish a relationship with your colleagues, you need to talk about interests beyond your work for e.g. a mutual love for reality TV shows or hobbies you have in common. Just remember to keep the topics appropriate.  Steer clear from controversial or sensitive issues.</p>
<h5>2. Make the most of the technology we have</h5>
