<p>You can journal about everything and anything, actually. I have a friend who uses her journal as a food diary for being more mindful about the food she eats. Another acquaintance of mine uses his journal to perform daily 'brain dumps' for clarifying and organizing his thoughts, priorities, etc. better. Therefore, anybody can keep a journal for any purpose they wish to.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things you can write about in your journal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things you are grateful for</li>
<li>Areas / Projects you need to prioritize</li>
<li>Reflect on your actions / behavior</li>
<li>Introspect and write down about your 'highs' and 'lows'</li>
<li>Set your Intentions for the day</li>
<li>Write down Long Term Goals</li>
<li>Track goals / habits</li>
<li>Think about your Life / Career Vision</li>
<li>New or unique Perspectives / Ideas / Insights</li>
</ul>
